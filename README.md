# About

PP Game 8x8 is a game developed for Arduino Uno with Atmega328P.

It was developed using PaltformIO with Visual Studio Code.

The game consists in a point and catch, using the joystick to catch randomly positioned points by pressing the touch switch.

In [this document](./doc/README.md) youÂ´ll find the electronic details to assemble this project.

# Rules

The game starts with 3 points. When player hits the random point gains 1 point. When player miss, then loses 1 point.

When the score reaches 9 point, it will reset to 3 points, and increase 1 level. Game has 3 levels. Afther winning the third level, game will end.
